# jqueryui-site
Straightforward HTML/CSS site which uses Jquery UI to liven things up. 

I created this as a project for my Advanced Web Development course. 
The point of it was to practice site setup, design, and animations, using pure HTML, CSS, Jquery, and JqueryUI (No Frameworks like Bootstrap!).
