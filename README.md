# jqueryui-site
Straightforward HTML/CSS site which uses Jquery UI to liven things up. 

I created this as a project for my Advanced Web Development course. 
The point of it was to practice advanced site setup, design, and added functionality, using pure HTML, CSS, Jquery, and JqueryUI (No Frameworks like Bootstrap). 

To view the site, you can download the repository and open up index.html in any web browser. It does not require a local development environment or server.
